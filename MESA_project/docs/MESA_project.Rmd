**Using cross-sectional case-control samples from Webuye, Kenya, evaluate the extent to which there are unique haplotypes among three polymorphic gene targets: AMA1, CSP, HistB.**

**Approach:** Implement haplotype inferences using DADA2 version 1.8, following this tutorial: https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html.

**Data aggregation:** Three primary data sets: Targeted amplicon sequencing data, quantitative PCR results, and social demographic data.

## BBmap Protocol 
* Describe the overall process here
    + Notes: 
        1. *write important notes*
        2. *write notes*

# Haplotype Inference **[Kelsey]**

## Running DADA2 to Create Haplotypes
* Determine social, economic, and demographic attributes to be used to evaluate similarity from previous literature on refusal/exemptions
* ~~Gather/clean social, economic, and demographic attribute data~~
    + Data at: `OneDrive/CA_NME_Diffusion/data/soc_econ_dem/yearly`
        - Race/Ethnicity (8 variables, proportions), Age (18 variables, proportions), Education (5 variables, proportions), Income (2 variables, dollars)
* ~~Determine metric to evaluate similarity among places based on multiple variables (Probably Euclidean distance, but maybe RMSE)~~
    + Notes: 
        1. *Weigh similarity of Race/Eth, Age, Education, and Income equally*
        2. *Must consider scale of input variables measured in different units (e.g., proportions versus dollars) and how overall concepts are scaled (9 variables vs 2 variables), as well as the metric output (e.g., what is the similarity metric result for perfectly similar and for perfectly dissimilar regions?)*
